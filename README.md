# ORBITAL

Orbital is an experimental simulator / game for orbital mechanics that runs in your browser.

I’m using it as a way to:

1.  advance my computer graphics and front-end skills,
2.  explore my interests in space travel and physics,
3.  practise pair-programming with LLMs in a low-stakes setting

The project is currently written in JavaScript (with scatterings of Rust, GLSL, and WebAssembly).

It makes heavy use of the excellent [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library, which gives convenient high-level APIs for browser-based graphics atop the cross-platform [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). That saves me having to implement low-level features from scratch, which I’ve already done in [my browser-based raytracer](https://gianluca.ai/raytracer/).
